Project used in the AdvancedML Time-Series course at Masterschool
Description : 
Problem Statement: The goal is to develop a model that can more precisely predict product sales. Specifically, we are forecasting future sales for a grocery store chain named 'Corporacion Favorita.' This is a demand forecasting scenario where accurate predictions are crucial. Given the large scale of the store, issues like stockouts and overstocking can become significant challenges. This case study aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict the unit sales of products sold by Corporacion Favorita, helping optimize inventory management.
